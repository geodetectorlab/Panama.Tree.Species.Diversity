This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(vegan) 
library(tibble)
```


```{r}
load("./marena1cns.tree1.rdata")
```


```{r}
tree.sum <- marena1cns.tree1 %>%
                mutate (sqrt.ba = sqrt(ba)) %>%
                filter(ba > 0) %>%
                group_by(plot, sp) %>%
                summarise(tree.count = n())%>%
                arrange(plot, desc(tree.count))
```
```{r}
tree.div <- tree.sum %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = sp, 
  values_from = tree.count,
  values_fill = 0
) 
attach(tree.div)
tree.div <- column_to_rownames(tree.div, var = "plot")
```
```{r}
shannon.panama <- data.frame(diversity(tree.div, index = "shannon"))
write.csv(shannon.panama, "panama.tree.species1.csv")
```


```{r}
#png("Panama Tree Species Index.png")
hist(shannon.panama$diversity.tree.div..index....shannon.., main = "Panama tree species index", col = "green", xlab = "Shannon Weiner Index", ylab = "Species Frequency")
#save.image()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
